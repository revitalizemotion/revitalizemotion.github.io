                I believe that healthful activity improves our quality of life.  I specialize in helping people overcome muscle imbalances that stem from injury, aging, or sedentary lifestyles.  Having worked with everyone from those with severe arthritis to elite athletes,  I teach my clients an applied philosophy: address weaknesses by harnessing strengths.  This panoramic approach to wellness stems from my extensive background in the health sciences.  After earning a B.S. in Nursing from University of Virginia, I worked as registered nurse for fifteen years.  Then, in 2004, I decided to channel My desire to heal people into a career in personal training.
            </p><p>
                I develop creative, specific programs by drawing from a variety of personal training modalities.  My proactive attitude toward education sets me apart as a perpetually growing resource for clients, students and colleagues.  I  have studied traditional personal training methods, a comprehensive Pilates curriculum, Ki-Hara resistance stretching, and most recently, Neurokinetic Therapy.

                I live in Potomac, MD with my dog, Timba.  In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, hiking, and spending time with my grown kids (when they let me).  My latest interest is learning to ride horses again (especially dressage).
